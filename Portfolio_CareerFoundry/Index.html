  		<p> Here are some reasons why I`m taking this course:</p>
  		<ul>
  			<li>I`ve always wanted to work with tech, but I suck at programming.</li>
  			<li>My wife has been trying to help me join the area.</li>
  			<li>Technology is the future, so it's a promising area.</li>
  			<li>I really don`t wanna work with the back-end part of tech.</li>
  		</ul>
